## CHESS GAME


### Input Style

chosen figure - starting position - target position
e.g. P (Pawn) - a2 - a4 -> Pa2a4

**we do not consider shortcut moves like "e8" as valid**

there is not need to indicate if a figure has to be killed, e.g. "Pa2xa4"

### Castling

small Rochade: O-O (letter O)
large Rochade: O-O-O

### En Passant

write "ep" at the end of your move to indicate an en passant move, e.g. "P2a4ep"

### Promotion

to promote a Pawn, write the requested figure token at the end of your input, e.g. "P7a8aQ" to request a Queen
