** CHESS GAME **

Input style:

- The input string must always contain 5 characters:
  - The first char represents the figure token which is asked to be moved
  - The second and the third characters represent the starting field
  - the fourth and fifth character represent the target field
  - the player does not have to specify the type of the figure he wants to kill, this is handled automatically if possible
